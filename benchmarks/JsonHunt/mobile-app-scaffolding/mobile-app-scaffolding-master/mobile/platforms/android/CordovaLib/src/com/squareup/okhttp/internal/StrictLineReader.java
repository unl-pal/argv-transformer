/**
 * Buffers input from an {@link InputStream} for reading lines.
 *
 * <p>This class is used for buffered reading of lines. For purposes of this class, a line ends with
 * "\n" or "\r\n". End of input is reported by throwing {@code EOFException}. Unterminated line at
 * end of input is invalid and will be ignored, the caller may use {@code hasUnterminatedLine()}
 * to detect it after catching the {@code EOFException}.
 *
 * <p>This class is intended for reading input that strictly consists of lines, such as line-based
 * cache entries or cache journal. Unlike the {@link java.io.BufferedReader} which in conjunction
 * with {@link java.io.InputStreamReader} provides similar functionality, this class uses different
 * end-of-input reporting and a more restrictive definition of a line.
 *
 * <p>This class supports only charsets that encode '\r' and '\n' as a single byte with value 13
 * and 10, respectively, and the representation of no other character contains these values.
 * We currently check in constructor that the charset is one of US-ASCII, UTF-8 and ISO-8859-1.
 * The default charset is US_ASCII.
