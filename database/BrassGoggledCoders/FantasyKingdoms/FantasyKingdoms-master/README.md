# FantasyKingdoms
Fantasy Kingdoms is a WIP BrassGoggledCoders mod, planning to implement most 'high fantasy' features such as Dwarves and Elves, and the associated weapons, blocks and other things. It also has a highly grimdark, occult, magic system planned.

##Credits
- Stygium is inspired by, and the name is from the Discworld book series
- The Wizard's Den concept is also inspired by/taken from the Soverign of the Seven Isles series by David A Wells
