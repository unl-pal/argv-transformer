# DriveLapse

This was a project I came up with a while ago wherein you could automatically take pictures with an Android device every X units of distance (i.e. when driving) with the intent of turning it into a distance-lapse movie (as opposed to a time-lapse one).  It sort of works, per se, in a really sloppy and flaky way, but hey, it was a good little first camera project.
