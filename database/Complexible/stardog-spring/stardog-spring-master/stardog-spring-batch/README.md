Stardog-Spring-Batch
==========

Licensed under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)
_Current Version **1.1.0**_

This is [Spring Framework](http://springsource.org) integration for [Stardog RDF Database](http://stardog.com). This API provides Spring Batch readers/writers for building batch applications with Stardog.

## What is it? ##

This API uses the SnarlTemplate and implements the ItemReader and ItemWriter interfaces from the Spring Batch API.  These can be composed with other readers, writers, and processors to create batch pipelines.


## Usage ##

To use Stardog Spring, we recommend, simply add: `com.stardog.ext:stardog-spring-batch:1.1.0` to your build dependency.

This does depend on installing the Stardog dependencies:

1. Download Stardog from [Stardog](http://stardog.com)

Once this is in place, you can create applications using a Spring application context.

2. In your Spring application context, create a `DataSourceFactoryBean` as your datasource, and reference it in a `SnarlTemplate` bean
3. Inject your `SnarlTemplate` bean appropriately, e.g. within the `ItemReader`/`Writers`


## Development ##

This project is built with Gradle, and can be easily imported into SpringSource Tool Suite or any other Eclipse based IDE.  If you are updating to a new Stardog version, the core stardog-spring batch instructions should be followed first.

1. Clone the git repository

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/stardog-union/stardog-spring.git
    ```

2. As of Stardog 7, for the unit tests to work you need to set the environment variable
   	`$STARDOG_LIB` to the `lib/` directory of your Stardog 7.X installation directory

3. Run `gradle build` in `stardog-spring/` project
4. Pick up the latest jar in `build/libs`, or alternatively run `gradle install` to install the built jar into your local M2 folder
5. Run `gradle build` in `stardog-spring-batch/`


## NOTE ##

This framework is in continuous development, please check the [issues](https://github.com/stardog-union/stardog-spring/issues) page. You're welcome to contribute.
