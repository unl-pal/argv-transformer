Stardog-Spring

_Current Version **1.1.0**_

This is [Spring Framework](http://springsource.org) integration for [Stardog RDF Database](http://stardog.com). This project
provides the core Spring integration, with the SnarlTemplate and DataSource classes.  Other projects build on this as the basis for
communicating with the Stardog database server.

## What is it? ##

This binding uses the native Stardog SNARL API and creates the appropriate Spring aware beans and template ease of use facilities for idiomatic Spring development.  Like a JDBC DataSource, and a JdbcTemplate, the Stardog Spring provides a DataSource abstraction and a SnarlTemplate abstraction.

The implementation requires the Stardog libraries to run, and therefore can run with:

* Stardog HTTP client/server
* Stardog embeddded, via DataSource configuration

For more information, go to the Stardog's [Spring Programming](http://stardog.com/docs/spring/) documentation.

The framework is currently targeted to the core Spring Framework (Spring 5.3.18 as of Stardog 7.9.1).  It has been tested in parts of the larger Spring ecosystem including Spring Web MVC.  It should also work well with other related Spring projects, such as Spring Integration.

## Usage ##

To use Stardog Spring, simply add: com.stardog.ext:stardog-spring:1.1.0 to your build dependencies.

This does require the Stardog dependencies to be installed, e.g.:

1. Download Stardog from [Stardog](http://stardog.com)

Once this is done, then a Spring application context can be constructed:

1. In your Spring application context, create a DataSourceFactoryBean as your datasource, and reference it in a SnarlTemplate bean
2. Inject your SnarlTemplate bean appropriately in your application.  It is thread safe.

If desired, you can create a SnarlTemplate programmatically outside of Spring by using a ConnectionConfiguration object from the Stardog API like so:

```groovy
ConnectionConfiguration cc = ConnectionConfiguration
	.to("myDB")
    .server("http://localhost:5820")
	.credentials("admin", "admin")

SnarlTemplate snarlTemplate = new SnarlTemplate()
snarlTemplate.setDataSource(new DataSource(cc))
```


## Development ##

This project is built with Gradle, and can be easily imported into SpringSource Tool Suite or any other Eclipse based IDE.

Before beginning, make sure you have a Stardog release downloaded, and the `mavenInstall` script run. 

1. Clone the git repository
2. Edit build.gradle to point to Stardog/lib folder, this is used for running the embedded server for testing, make sure you have a license installed and the Stardog server is stopped.  Also the STARDOG_HOME environment must be set.
3. Run `gradle build`
4. Run `gradle install` to install the new build into your `.m2/repository/...` M2 cache for use in the stardog-spring-batch build

All tests should pass with a working Stardog download, including a license.  Common issues can be seen with "gradle build --debug", where Stardog does exit on invalid licenses.  When this happens, you will see a `buffer underflow` error that, where the JVM running the embedded Stardog has halted.  The exit of the embedded server does cause the Gradle build to exit not so gracefully, so running with --debug for unexpected errors will show what happened.  Likewise, you can take a look at the stardog.log file to see if a license error occured.  If you do not wish to run Emma code coverage tool, remove it from the Gradle configuration
