 * This class inherits a {@code connected} field from the superclass. That field
 * is <strong>not</strong> used to indicate not whether this URLConnection is
 * currently connected. Instead, it indicates whether a connection has ever been
 * attempted. Once a connection has been attempted, certain properties (request
 * header fields, request method, etc.) are immutable. Test the {@code
 * connection} field on this class for null/non-null to determine of an instance
 * is currently connected to a server.
