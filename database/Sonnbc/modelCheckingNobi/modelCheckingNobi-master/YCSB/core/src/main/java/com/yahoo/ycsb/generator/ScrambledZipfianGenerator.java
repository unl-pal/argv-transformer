/**
 * A generator of a zipfian distribution. It produces a sequence of items, such that some items are more popular than others, according
 * to a zipfian distribution. When you construct an instance of this class, you specify the number of items in the set to draw from, either
 * by specifying an itemcount (so that the sequence is of items from 0 to itemcount-1) or by specifying a min and a max (so that the sequence is of 
 * items from min to max inclusive). After you construct the instance, you can change the number of items by calling nextInt(itemcount) or nextLong(itemcount).
 * 
 * Unlike @ZipfianGenerator, this class scatters the "popular" items across the itemspace. Use this, instead of @ZipfianGenerator, if you
 * don't want the head of the distribution (the popular items) clustered together.
