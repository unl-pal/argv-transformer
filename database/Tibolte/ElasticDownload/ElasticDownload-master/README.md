Recently me and my friend came across this downloading animation on Dribble: https://dribbble.com/shots/1887815-Download?list=users&offset=4
We found it so nice that we decided to develop it for Android!

We implemented it with a custom view, playing with canvas rotation and path drawing.

## System Requirement
Android v2.2+

Usage
===============================

Grab it from maven:

```groovy
    implementation 'com.github.tibolte:elasticdownload:1.0.+'
````


Declare this view in your layout like below, it's also possible to inflate it manually.

```java
    <is.arontibo.library.ElasticDownloadView
        android:id="@+id/elastic_download_view"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:layout_centerInParent="true"/>
````

At first, call startIntro() to make the view be able to display any percentage:

```java
    @InjectView(R.id.elastic_download_view) ElasticDownloadView mElasticDownloadView;
    
    mElasticDownloadView.startIntro();
````

Set any progress:

```java
    mElasticDownloadView.setProgress(25);
````

Notify if the download has failed or not:

```java
    mElasticDownloadView.success(); //This function moves the cursor to 100 if the progress has not been set already
    
    mElasticDownloadView.fail();
````
