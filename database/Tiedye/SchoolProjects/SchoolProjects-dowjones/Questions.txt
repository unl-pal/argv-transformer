Questions

-Knowledge-
1. Storing data as binary databases have the advantage of random access
   capabilities which allow fast access of records from any point in the file.
2. Records are stored as whole objects in the file.
3. Text files can be view properly in a text editor as the text editor is
   designed to read encoded text data.
4. Text editors cannot read binary data as is in a format that the text editor
   does not recognize.
5. Write only writes the least significant 8 bits of the int to the file
   (1 byte), writeInt writes the whole integer to the file (4 bytes).

-Thinking-
1. Random accessing a file is way in accessing the file which allows you to read
   any byte in the file in any order.  This allows you at access certain 
   information in a file without having to read all the information up to that
   point.  In java this is done with the RandomAccessFile class.
