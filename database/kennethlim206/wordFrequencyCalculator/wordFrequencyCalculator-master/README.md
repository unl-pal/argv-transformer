# Word Frequency Calculator

This is a program I wrote for my data structures class that counts the frequency of the words in a text file and returns the 20 most frequently used words. I implemented a hash dictionary to store the words from the text file. This repository includes a Dictionary and Set interface. The calculator program is called WordFreqs.java. There are also two text files that I used as test files.
