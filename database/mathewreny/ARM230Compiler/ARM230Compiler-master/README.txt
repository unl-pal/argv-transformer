## How not to use git

The contents of this project are a good reminder of what not to 
do with git. I was not properly aquainted with the technology 
since this project was my first time using git.

## Status

This project was not intended to be used by anyone besides my 
classmates. I have not maintained it since passing the course.

To compile you should run the Installer program.
To run this program you must change the permission
by running the following linux commands:

$> chmod 775 Installer
$> ./Installer

You only have to Install once. and you can see
exactly what the installer is doing by opening
the file using the following linux command:

$> vi Installer

To run the program, you must specify a .s230
file to be read. If the file is a .S230 file,
you must set the "-S" flag. To run the program
you type either of the following commands:

$> ./Compiler -f file.s230
or
$> ./Compiler -f file.S230 -S

That concludes the instructions on how to
run the program. If you need help with the file
formats please read their text files.
