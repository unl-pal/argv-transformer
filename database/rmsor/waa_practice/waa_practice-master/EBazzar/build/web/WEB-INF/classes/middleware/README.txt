Copied the middleware package from paul's MainProjectMoreDetail, which he said had the latest changes.

Had to also get the business.util.StringParse class, and the business.DbUrl.java class,
and then had to modify the import statements in SimpleConnectionPool and DataAccessUtil(?).

Also needed to get the ParseException from business package.
