# Bamini to Unicode Tamil Converter

This is a small command-line Java application that can convert Tamil text encoded in Bamini (and it's variants
like TamilBible) to its unicode equivalent.

The application can also extract text from PowerPoint files and convert them to unicode Tamil.

## History

This project started out as my Church planned to use OpenLP instead of PowerPoint to project songs. Since
most of our songs were in PowerPoint and were in a non-unicode font (TamilBible), there was a need to extract
the content out from PowerPoint files and convert them to standard unicode Tamil.
