Code authors/Copyright holders:

This work by Sky Welch is primarily based on the Android port of Mandelbrot Maps
by Alasdair Corbett. Said Android work is based on Iain Parris's original web applet 
version of Mandelbrot Maps. Some of the colour scheme code is derived from Edward 
Mallia's later version. A third version was produced by Taige Liu but, to the 
best of my knowledge, none of his code was reused.
