/**
 *  The Blur class is a program that reads an image file in TIFF format, blurs
 *  it with a 3x3 box blurring kernel, writes the blurred image as a TIFF file,
 *  and displays both images.
 *
 *  The Blur program takes up to two parameters.  The first parameter is
 *  the name of the TIFF-format file to read.  (The output image file is
 *  constructed by adding "blur_" to the beginning of the input filename.)
 *  An optional second parameter specifies the number of iterations of the
 *  box blurring operation.  (The default is one iteration.)  For example, if
 *  you run
 *
 *         java Blur engine.tiff 5
 *
 *  then Blur will read engine.tiff, perform 5 iterations of blurring, and
 *  write the blurred image to blur_engine.tiff .
